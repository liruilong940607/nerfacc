Volumetric Rendering
===================================

In `nerfacc`, the volumetric rendering pipeline is broken down into 2 steps:

1. **Sampling**: This is the process of casting a ray through the scene and
   generate samples along the way.

2. **Rendering**: This is the process of accumulating samples along the rays into final image.
   In this step we also need to query the attributes (a.k.a. color and density) of those samples
   generated by raymarching.
